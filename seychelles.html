        <p>I discharged from the army during COVID-19, man that sucked! But then a glimpse of hope, a ray of sunshine came along.
            I saw a commercial that there are some flights to an exotic new destination: The Seychelles. 
            I didn't know anything about that place but it sounded like the perfect oppurtunity to escape from the COVID madness.
            I texted my good friend from the army, Omer, and I offered him this place. He was sold and the jig was on!
            We met and started planning the trip, booked AirBnBs, we learned about the history of the place and were so excited.
            Finally, we were there and it was love from first sight! The beaches, the islands, the warm people, the hospitality,
            everything was perfect. We spent 2 wonderful weeks in The Seychelles and I just yearn to return.
            We came back to our country, to the harsh reality of the second quarantine but we will always remember this trip.

        <h2>Travel Tips for Seychelles</h2>
        <div class="tips">
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>Island Hopping:</strong> Don't stick to one island! Ferries and domestic flights make it
                    easy to explore Mahe, Praslin, and La Digue.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Sun Protection:</strong> The equatorial sun is strong. Use high SPF sunscreen, wear hats,
                    and seek shade during peak hours.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Local Currency:</strong> While Euros are widely accepted, having some Seychellois Rupees
                    (SCR) is useful for smaller purchases and local markets.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Respect Nature:</strong> The Seychelles prides itself on conservation. Avoid touching coral,
                    don't litter, and respect wildlife.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Water Shoes:</strong> Some beaches have coral fragments, so water shoes can be helpful for
                    comfortable swimming and walking.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Creole Cuisine:</strong> Indulge in local dishes like fish curry, grilled fish, and fresh
                    tropical fruits.
