        <p>I discharged from the army during COVID-19, man that sucked! But then a glimpse of hope, a ray of sunshine came along.
            I saw a commercial that there are some flights to an exotic new destination: The Seychelles. 
            I didn't know anything about that place but it sounded like the perfect oppurtunity to escape from the COVID madness.
            I texted my good friend from the army, Omer, and I offered him this place. He was sold and the jig was on!
            We met and started planning the trip, booked AirBnBs, we learned about the history of the place and were so excited.
            Finally, we were there and it was love from first sight! The beaches, the islands, the warm people, the hospitality,
            everything was perfect. We spent 2 wonderful weeks in The Seychelles and I just wait to return there.
            We came back to our country, to the harsh reality of the second quarantine but we will always remember this trip.

                    <strong>Hiking</strong>
                    <p>There are some great hiking trails in the mountains of Mahe. We went on three trails in one day!
                        From above, you can see the whole island but on one of the peaks it's started raining and a great fog
                        obscured the view so we ran back down soaking wet. It was still fun though.

        <h2>Travel Tips for Seychelles</h2>
        <div class="tips">
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>Island Hopping:</strong> First of all, don't sleep in one island. also, take excursions to small islands,
                    explore their trails and meet some cute tortoises!
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Sun Protection:</strong> No matter when you come to The Seychelles, it will be hot. Bring sun cream,
                    a hat and stay in the shade. Though you can get great tan during this trip.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Local Currency:</strong> Seychellois Rupees(SCR) is great. It's lower than the ILS so it's cheap.
                    Also, they have turtles on their bills.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Respect Nature:</strong> Avoid touching coral,
                    don't litter, and respect wildlife. Also, while temting, don't feed the giant tortise. They're cute but they can 
                    snap you finger!
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Creole Cuisine:</strong> Man, do I love Creole food and I didn't even knew what is was!
                    It's like a mix of French and Indiand cuisine. A lot of seafood, with a lot of curry. 
                    Absolutely the best!
