#This is a README file!
##Hello there!
This is my travel blog i'm building as I progress with the "full- stack for developers" CodeCademy course.
This blog shows my latest travels around the world since I discharged from the army.
Now, remember this is only a prototype. I will upgrade this site constantly, with new designs, new technologies as I learn
and hopefully, with more travels.
Currently, I'm planning to implement some JS and add more pages.
I will add pages to every adventure entry, design a nav bar, add responsiveness, and make the site more accesible.
See you on the other side! (RIP Hillel Slovak)
